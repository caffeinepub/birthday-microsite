## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the birthday microsite from a pink childish aesthetic to a mature romantic experience with sophisticated colors, dramatic animations, background music, and decorative elements.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace predominantly pink color scheme with mature romantic palette (reds, golds, deep purples, whites)
- Add visible red lipstick kiss mark pattern to letter background
- Integrate royalty-free romantic background music that plays after envelope opens
- Enhance firecracker burst animation with dramatic particle effects and sound
- Add animated bouquet giving sequence between question flow and envelope reveal
- Implement flying butterflies throughout the microsite with realistic flight patterns and wing movements

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a sophisticated romantic microsite with elegant colors, dramatic firecracker bursts, floating butterflies, an animated bouquet presentation, romantic background music, and kiss marks decorating the letter—creating a mature, memorable birthday experience.
